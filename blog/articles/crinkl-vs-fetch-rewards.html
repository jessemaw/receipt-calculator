                <div class="article-disclosure">
                    <strong>Disclosure:</strong> This article contains a referral link for Crinkl. If you sign up through our link, you get 500 bonus points and we earn a small commission. This does not affect our analysis — we present both apps' strengths and weaknesses honestly.
                </div>

                <p>If you want to <strong>scan receipts for money</strong>, you have more options in 2026 than ever before. Two apps worth comparing head to head are <strong>Fetch Rewards</strong>, the long-established heavyweight with millions of monthly active users, and <strong>Crinkl</strong>, a newer contender that advertises higher base payouts and category multipliers.</p>

                <p>This <strong>receipt app comparison for 2026</strong> breaks down exactly how much each platform pays per receipt, what bonus features they offer, and how your weekly earnings stack up. We also cover something many people overlook: you can use both apps on the same receipts simultaneously, and there is no reason not to.</p>

                <p><em>Note: There are other receipt apps beyond these two — including ReceiptPal, Ibotta, and Shopkick — but this article focuses specifically on Crinkl vs Fetch because they both accept any receipt from any store, making them the most directly comparable for passive receipt scanning.</em></p>

                <h2>How Each Receipt Scanning App Works</h2>

                <h3>How Crinkl Works</h3>

                <p>Crinkl is a newer entry in the <strong>receipt rewards</strong> space. The core loop is straightforward: scan a receipt, earn 100 points (worth $0.10). Where Crinkl differentiates itself is through <strong>category multipliers</strong> that increase your payout based on what you bought. Grocery and restaurant receipts earn 3x, coffee purchases earn 2x, and apparel earns 1.5x. The app also includes a daily streak system and weekly volume bonuses designed to reward consistent users.</p>

                <p>One thing to be upfront about: Crinkl does not have the established track record of Fetch Rewards. It has a limited public web presence, and the earning rates discussed here are based on the app's stated structure rather than years of independent user verification. That said, the rates it advertises are notably generous compared to more established competitors.</p>

                <p>Crinkl pays out rewards in <strong>Bitcoin through Cash App</strong>, which sets it apart from traditional receipt apps. The minimum cashout is $5, and importantly, <strong>Crinkl points never expire</strong> — a significant advantage over Fetch's 90-day inactivity policy. For users interested in earning Bitcoin passively through everyday spending, this is a compelling option.</p>

                <p>Crinkl also has an optional <strong>$CRINKL token</strong> integration that provides boosted earning tiers for users who hold the token. Beyond that, the app features <strong>seasonal leaderboards</strong> where top scanners can earn bonus rewards, and <strong>targeted brand missions</strong> that offer additional points for purchasing specific products. These features are still developing as the app grows.</p>

                <p>If you want to try Crinkl, <a href="https://app.crinkl.xyz/welcome?ref=QDTGIT8">signing up through this link</a> gives you 500 bonus points ($0.50) to start.</p>

                <h3>How Fetch Rewards Works</h3>

                <p>Fetch Rewards is one of the most popular <strong>receipt scanning apps</strong> in the United States, with millions of monthly active users and partnerships with more than 500 brands. You scan any receipt within 14 days of purchase, earn a base of 25 points (roughly $0.025), and can earn significantly more when your purchases include partner brand products. Brand-specific bonus offers can range from 250 to well over 5,000 points per qualifying purchase.</p>

                <p>Fetch offers redemption through digital gift cards from major retailers like Amazon and Target, Visa prepaid cards, and charitable donations. The minimum redemption threshold is 3,000 points, which works out to about $3. Note that Fetch does not offer direct Bitcoin, PayPal, or bank deposit options natively — you would need to redeem a Visa prepaid card and transfer the balance if you want cash. Fetch also launched the <strong>Fetch American Express credit card</strong> in fall 2025, adding another way to earn within the ecosystem.</p>

                <p>One drawback to be aware of: <strong>Fetch points expire after 90 days of account inactivity</strong>. If you forget to scan a receipt or engage with the app for three months, you lose everything. Some users have also reported that gift card redemption costs have gradually increased over time in terms of points required.</p>

                <h2>Per-Receipt Earnings: Crinkl vs Fetch Rewards</h2>

                <p>This is where the comparison gets interesting, and where Crinkl makes its strongest case as a <strong>Fetch Rewards alternative</strong>.</p>

                <p>On a pure base-rate comparison, Crinkl pays <strong>$0.10 per receipt</strong> while Fetch pays approximately <strong>$0.025 per receipt</strong>. That is a 4x difference on every single scan before any bonuses are considered.</p>

                <p>When you factor in Crinkl's category multipliers, the gap widens further:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grocery or restaurant receipt on Crinkl:</strong> 300 points ($0.30)</li>
                    <li><strong>Coffee receipt on Crinkl:</strong> 200 points ($0.20)</li>
                    <li><strong>Apparel receipt on Crinkl:</strong> 150 points ($0.15)</li>
                    <li><strong>Any receipt on Fetch (base):</strong> 25 points (~$0.025)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, this comparison is not entirely apples to apples. Fetch Rewards does not rely on category multipliers. Instead, it offers <strong>brand-specific bonus points</strong> that can be substantial if you buy products from partner brands. A single qualifying purchase could earn you 1,000 or more bonus points. The catch is that these bonuses are unpredictable and depend on what you buy and which offers are active at any given time.</p>

                <p><strong>To be fair to Fetch:</strong> If you are someone who regularly buys from major brands like Coca-Cola, General Mills, or P&G, and you actively check and activate Fetch offers before shopping, you can potentially earn significantly more than the base rate. Power users who optimize for brand bonuses report earning $20-50+ per month on Fetch. But this requires effort and intentional shopping — it is not passive.</p>

                <p>For the average user scanning everyday receipts without specifically chasing brand deals, Crinkl's stated base rate is meaningfully higher.

                <h2>Bonus Features Comparison</h2>

                <h3>Streaks and Volume Bonuses</h3>

                <p>Crinkl has a <strong>daily streak system</strong> that adds 10 points per consecutive day of scanning, capping at an additional 500 points. It also offers a <strong>weekly bonus of 500 points</strong> when you scan at least 10 receipts in a week. These features reward consistency and can add a few extra dollars per month for active users.</p>

                <p>Fetch does not have a direct equivalent to streak bonuses. Its engagement features lean more toward <strong>Fetch Play</strong>, a gamified feature where you can earn additional points through mini-games within the app. The earning potential from Fetch Play is generally modest but adds engagement beyond receipt scanning.</p>

                <h3>Referral Programs</h3>

                <p>Fetch wins clearly on referrals. Each successful referral earns you <strong>2,000 points ($2.00)</strong> compared to Crinkl's <strong>500 points ($0.50)</strong>. If you actively refer friends and family to apps, Fetch's referral payout is four times more generous.</p>

                <h3>Points Expiration</h3>

                <p>This is a major differentiator. <strong>Crinkl points never expire.</strong> You can take a break from the app and come back months later with your balance intact. Fetch points expire after 90 consecutive days of inactivity, meaning you need to stay engaged or risk losing your earnings. For casual users who might not scan receipts every week, Crinkl's no-expiration policy is a significant advantage.</p>

                <h3>Redemption and Ecosystem</h3>

                <p>Fetch has the advantage of a mature redemption ecosystem. You can cash out to gift cards from dozens of retailers, Visa prepaid cards, or donate points to charity. The Fetch American Express credit card gives power users another way to stack rewards on top of receipt scanning.</p>

                <p>Crinkl takes a different approach: <strong>rewards are paid out in Bitcoin through Cash App</strong>. The minimum cashout is $5. This is ideal if you want actual money rather than gift cards, and it appeals to users who are interested in Bitcoin. If you are not comfortable with Bitcoin or do not have Cash App, this could be a drawback — though setting up Cash App is free and straightforward.</p>

                <h2>Weekly and Monthly Earning Potential</h2>

                <p>Here are realistic numbers for a moderately active user who scans about 15 receipts per week, with a mix of grocery, restaurant, and other purchases.</p>

                <h3>Crinkl: Estimated Weekly Earnings</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>10 grocery/restaurant receipts at 3x: 3,000 points</li>
                    <li>5 other receipts at base rate: 500 points</li>
                    <li>Weekly bonus (10+ receipts): 500 points</li>
                    <li>Daily streak (7 days): 70 points</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly total: ~4,070 points ($4.07)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly estimate: ~$16.28</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fetch Rewards: Estimated Weekly Earnings</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>15 receipts at base rate: 375 points</li>
                    <li>Estimated brand bonuses (3-4 qualifying items): ~1,500 points</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly total: ~1,875 points ($1.88)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly estimate: ~$7.50</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fetch with Active Offer Optimization</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>15 receipts at base rate: 375 points</li>
                    <li>Heavy brand bonus chasing (8-10 qualifying items): ~4,000 points</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly total: ~4,375 points ($4.38)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly estimate: ~$17.50</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important caveats:</strong> Crinkl's figures are based on its advertised rates, and as a less-established app, there is limited long-term data to confirm these rates will remain consistent. Fetch's "optimized" estimate assumes you actively check offers, buy from partner brands, and plan your shopping around bonuses — which takes real effort. Most users fall somewhere between the base and optimized Fetch estimates.</p>

                <p>The takeaway: for <strong>passive receipt scanning without brand-specific shopping</strong>, Crinkl's stated rates are significantly more generous. For users who are willing to put in effort optimizing Fetch offers, the gap narrows or disappears. The good news? You can do both.</p>

                <h2>Who Should Use Which App?</h2>

                <h3>Choose Crinkl If:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>You want the highest base rate per receipt without needing to buy specific brands</li>
                    <li>You scan a lot of grocery and restaurant receipts (the 3x multiplier is compelling)</li>
                    <li>You value consistent, predictable earnings over variable brand bonuses</li>
                    <li>You want rewards paid out in Bitcoin through Cash App</li>
                    <li>You want points that never expire</li>
                    <li>You are comfortable trying a less-established app that is still building its track record</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Choose Fetch Rewards If:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>You want a proven platform with years of history and millions of users</li>
                    <li>You frequently buy products from major brands and are willing to activate offers</li>
                    <li>You prefer gift card redemption over Bitcoin/cash</li>
                    <li>You want features beyond receipt scanning like Fetch Play and Fetch Shop</li>
                    <li>You have a large network for referrals ($2 per referral is strong)</li>
                    <li>You want access to the Fetch Amex credit card for additional earning</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Best Answer: Use Both</h3>

                <p><strong>You can scan the same receipt on both Crinkl and Fetch Rewards.</strong> There is no rule against it. Each app processes your receipt independently, so you earn points on both platforms from a single trip to the store.</p>

                <p>If you are serious about <strong>earning money from scanning receipts</strong>, running both apps simultaneously is the optimal strategy. It takes an extra 30 seconds per receipt and effectively doubles your earning potential. This is the approach we recommend for anyone looking to get the most out of <strong>receipt rewards apps in 2026</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Can you use Crinkl and Fetch Rewards on the same receipt?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Both apps process receipts independently, so you can scan the same receipt on both Crinkl and Fetch Rewards to earn points on each platform. You can also use other receipt apps like ReceiptPal on the same receipts.</p>

                <h3>How much does Crinkl pay per receipt?</h3>
                <p>Crinkl's base rate is 100 points ($0.10) per receipt. Grocery and restaurant receipts earn 3x (300 points / $0.30), coffee receipts earn 2x (200 points / $0.20), and apparel receipts earn 1.5x (150 points / $0.15).</p>

                <h3>How does Crinkl pay out?</h3>
                <p>Crinkl pays rewards in Bitcoin through Cash App. The minimum cashout is $5. You will need a Cash App account to receive payments.</p>

                <h3>Do Crinkl points expire?</h3>
                <p>No. Crinkl points never expire, which is a significant advantage over Fetch Rewards where points expire after 90 days of inactivity.</p>

                <h3>Is Crinkl legitimate?</h3>
                <p>Crinkl is a newer app with a limited track record compared to established platforms like Fetch Rewards. Its advertised rates are generous, and it does pay out in Bitcoin through Cash App. However, there is less independent user data available compared to apps that have been around for years. We recommend trying it alongside a proven app like Fetch so you are not relying on a single platform.</p>

                <h3>Do Fetch Rewards points expire?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Fetch Rewards points expire after 90 consecutive days of account inactivity. As long as you scan a receipt, redeem a reward, or engage with the app at least once every 90 days, your points remain active.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line: Crinkl vs Fetch Rewards in 2026</h2>

                <p>Fetch Rewards is the established leader with a proven track record, a large brand partner network, and a mature ecosystem that includes gift cards, Visa prepaid cards, and a credit card. For users who buy a lot of partner-brand products and actively optimize their offers, Fetch's bonus structure can be lucrative.</p>

                <p>Crinkl is the up-and-coming challenger offering a significantly higher base rate per receipt, category multipliers that reward everyday spending on groceries, dining, and coffee, and Bitcoin payouts through Cash App. Its earning structure is more straightforward and predictable, points never expire, and it does not require you to buy specific brands. The trade-off is that it is a less-established platform with a shorter track record.</p>

                <p>On pure per-receipt earnings for everyday purchases, Crinkl's stated rates are hard to beat. On ecosystem maturity, redemption flexibility, and brand partnerships, Fetch has the clear advantage. The smartest move is to use both.</p>
